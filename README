Example:

  ./isophotes 1024 2.0 nofill isophotes.png

or

  ./isophotes 1024 1.4 fill isophotes.png

"Filling" also fills the corners of the image. This is to enable
fast, OpenGL-scaling of the texture.

However, it has some problems:
- the image is scaled by sqrt(2), so it is only an approximate
  isophote map
- scaling of the texture matrix with a repeated isophote texture
  may look right most of the time, but it is not

If you find yourself doing this, consider the following options:
- use several texture maps with various widths [recommended]
- use a 1D texture map (half red, half white); this is roughly
  the same as if you used equidistant concentric circles
  (which is an even worse approximation of the isophotes than the
   "fill" version, but it does not have the repeat-problem)
